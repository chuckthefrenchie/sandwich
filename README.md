Sandwich Maker App 

Its a Single-page web application that allows a user to build a virtual sandwich with any combination of N layers of ingredients where a single layer consists of a single ingredient. You can use an ingredient more than once. The ingredients can be any of the following: peanut butter, apricot jam, bananas, honey, or chocolate chips. 

You can view and modify previous sandwiches. Every sandwich can have a unique identifier that conforms to a 10 digit alphanumeric string where any two characters can be separated by a hyphen. You can see the distribution of ingredients of all sandwiches ever made in some type of visualization.
